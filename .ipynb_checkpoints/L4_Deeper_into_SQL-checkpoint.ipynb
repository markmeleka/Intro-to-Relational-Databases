    "Rules for normalized tables:  \n",
    "\n",
    "**1.Every row has the same number of columns.**  \n",
    "In practice, the database system won't let us literally have different numbers of columns in different rows. But if we have columns that are sometimes empty (null) and sometimes not, or if we stuff multiple values into a single field, we're bending this rule.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The example to keep in mind here is the diet table from the zoo database. Instead of trying to stuff multiple foods for a species into a single row about that species, we separate them out. This makes it much easier to do aggregations and comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.There is a unique key and everything in a row says something about the key.**  \n",
    "The key may be one column or more than one. It may even be the whole row, as in the diet table. But we don't have duplicate rows in a table.  \n",
    "\n",
    "More importantly, if we are storing non-unique facts — such as people's names — we distinguish them using a unique identifier such as a serial number. This makes sure that we don't combine two people's grades or parking tickets just because they have the same name.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**3.Facts that don't relate to the key belong in different tables.**  \n",
    "The example here was the items table, which had items, their locations, and the location's street addresses in it. The address isn't a fact about the item; it's a fact about the location. Moving it to a separate table saves space and reduces ambiguity, and we can always reconstitute the original table using a join.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**4.Tables shouldn't imply relationships that don't exist.**  \n",
    "The example here was the job_skills table, where a single row listed one of a person's technology skills (like 'Linux') and one of their language skills (like 'French'). This made it look like their Linux knowledge was specific to French, or vice versa ... when that isn't the case in the real world. Normalizing this involved splitting the tech skills and job skills into separate tables.  "

    "Counting rows in a single table is something you’ve seen many times before in this course. A column aggregated with the count aggregation function will return the number of rows in the table, or the number of rows for each value of a group by clause.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, you saw queries like these back in Lesson 2:  \n",
    "\n",
    "select count(*) from animals;  \n",
    "-- returns the number of animals in the zoo  \n",
    "\n",
    "select count(*) from animals where species = ‘gorilla’;  \n",

    "\n",
    "Products and Sales  \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we want to know how many times we have sold each product. In other words, for each sku value in the products table, we want to know the number of times it occurs in the sales table. We might start out with a query like this:  \n",
    "\n",
    "select products.name, products.sku, count(*) as num\n",
    "  from products join sales\n",
    "    on products.sku = sales.sku\n",
    "  group by products.sku;\n",
    "But this query might not do exactly what we want. If a particular sku has never been sold — if there are no entries for it in the sales table — then this query will not return a row for it at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to see a row with the number zero in it, we’ll be disappointed!\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is a way to get the database to give us a count with a zero in it. To do this, we’ll need to change two things about this query —\n",
    "~~~~\n",
    "select products.name, products.sku, count(sales.sku) as num\n",
    "  from products left join sales\n",
    "    on products.sku = sales.sku\n",
    "  group by products.sku;\n",
    "  ~~~~\n",
    "This query will give us a row for every product in the products table, even the ones that have no sales in the sales table.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What’s changed? First, we’re using count(sales.sku) instead of count(*). This means that the database will count only rows where sales.sku is defined, instead of all rows.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we’re using a left join instead of a plain join.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Um, so what’s a left join?**  \n",
    "SQL supports a number of variations on the theme of joins. The kind of join that you have seen earlier in this course is called an inner join, and it is the most common kind of join — so common that SQL doesn’t actually make us say \"inner join\" to do one.  \n",
    "\n",
    "But the second most common is the left join, and its mirror-image partner, the right join. The words “left” and “right” refer to the tables to the left and right of the join operator. (Above, the left table is products and the right table is sales.)  \n",
    "\n",
    "A regular (inner) join returns only those rows where the two tables have entries matching the join condition. A left join returns all those rows, plus the rows where the left table has an entry but the right table doesn’t. And a right join does the same but for the right table.  \n",
    "\n",
    "(Just as “join” is short for “inner join”, so too is “left join” actually short for “left outer join”. But SQL lets us just say “left join”, which is a lot less typing. So we’ll do that.)"
